#RingRing
RingRing is a webapp that allows organizations to manage their oncall lists. It has support for Twilio VoIP and allows teams to use just 1 oncall number for everyone. When the oncall number is called, the call will be redirected to whoever is oncall. If the oncall person doesn't pickup the phone, RingRing can retry and/or escalate the call to the team's manager.
